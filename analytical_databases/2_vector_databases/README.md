# Vector databases
Vector databases are very popular in AI applications, but have been used in other fields as well.
They are used to store and query vectors, which are a type of data structure that can be used to represent many things.
For example, vectors can be used to represent images, text, audio, and video.

# Vectors
Vectors are arrays of numbers one number for each dimension of the vector.
High dimensional vectors are used to represent complex objects, such as images, text, audio, and video. Vector representations are also called embeddings.

# Querying vectors
Querying is often based on similarity, which is a type of search that finds similar items in a database. You provide an embedding and the database returns the most similar embeddings in the database. This is useful for many applications, such as finding similar images, text, audio, and video.

# PGVector
Here we use an extension for Postgres to handle vector similarity searches.
This is a great way to add vector databasing functionality in existing applications such as Django.
