# Embedding models

Specific AI models turn images, text, audio, and video into vectors. Embedding them into a vector space that was trained on a large dataset. This is a common technique in AI, and is used in many applications.

## Benefits of embedding
Vector embeddings allow us a standard representation of complex objects. This allows us to compare them, and to use them in AI models. Embeddings generated by a model are of fixed size and all array entries are floating point numbers. This makes them easy to store and query. This can be compared with hashing, which also represent complex objects with a fixed sized output.

## Embedding models
Here we use various embedding models that can be run locally using the embetter package.
